# Playbook: Deployment Hardening

## Objective
Ensure the deployment is secure, observable, and resilient in production.

## Steps
1. **Security baseline**
   - Validate secrets handling, least privilege, and network controls.
2. **Observability**
   - Ensure logs, metrics, and traces are configured.
   - Define alert thresholds and escalation paths.
3. **Resilience**
   - Configure retries, timeouts, and circuit breakers.
   - Validate failover or rollback mechanisms.
4. **Load readiness**
   - Run baseline load tests or traffic simulations.
   - Capture performance baselines.

## Deliverables
- Hardening checklist
- Alerting configuration summary
- Rollback plan
- Performance baseline report
